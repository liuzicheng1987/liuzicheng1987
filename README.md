## Introduction

Hello, I'm Patrick Urbanke (劉自成), and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I spent 10 years living in Asia, which is why I have a Chinese name and my GitHub handle is liuzicheng1987. Currently, I reside in Munich, Germany. I am fluent in English, Mandarin Chinese, and German, and I'm happy to communicate in any of these languages.

I hold a doctoral degree, with my dissertation focusing on machine learning.

I am the co-founder of [Code17](https://www.code17.io), where we develop [getML](https://www.getml.com), an advanced tool for automated feature engineering on relational data and time series.

Additionally, I am the main author of [reflect-cpp](https://github.com/getml/reflect-cpp), a C++ library for serialization, deserialization, and validation through reflection. This library is akin to Python's Pydantic or Rust's serde, offering powerful and flexible solutions for C++ developers.

I am a strong proponent of functional programming and am greatly influenced by theoretical constructs such as category theory and type theory.

Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, particularly on topics like history, politics, language, and, of course, coding. I also enjoy reading novels, with some of my favorite books being "Animal Farm" and "Homage to Catalonia" by George Orwell, and "Die Revolution entläßt ihre Kinder" by Wolfgang Leonhard.

Feel free to explore my repositories and projects. I'm always open to collaboration and discussion!
